Sick and tired of waiting
So we learned to fly
What a wild ride
Brave enough to make it
And we're here to stay
Yeah we found a way
進むべき道のその向こうに
We can make a new world where nobody knows
いつか夢に見たあの場所を
We're all the way up up up
We'll never look down down down
Breaking the ceiling
'cause I believe the world is ours
We're all the way up up up
We'll never look down down down
I got a feeling that it was written in the stars
Written in the stars
I wasn't born to follow
So I took the lead
I didn't lose the dream
Forget about tomorrow
Bring it on tonight
The sky's burning bright
We're all the way up up up
We'll never look down down down
Breaking the ceiling
'cause I believe the world is ours
We're all the way up up up
We'll never look down down down
I got a feeling that it was written in the stars
Written in the stars
If you ever get stuck with no where to run
When you're covered in clouds,
I'll show you the sun
Our time to shine, we've just begun
We're all the way up up up
これ以上はもうないくらい
Breaking the ceiling,
'cause I believe the world is ours
We're all the way up up up
届かないくらいfly high
I got a feeling that it was written in the stars
That it was written in the stars
Written in the stars
